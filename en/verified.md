<h3><i class="fas fa-certificate"></i>Verification rules</h3>

#### _Any violation of the rules in this section will result in a **wipe and permanent badge removal**._

1.  Player must have not been wiped in the last 3 months. (Self wipes and FL wipes do not count!).
    
2.  Player must have been active (in the community) for the past month!
    
3.  Player must have an account that is at least 28 days old.

<h3><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Special requirements</h3>

#### _Above is not needed for this **except rule 3**._
You do not need to have done one of the “normal” requirements if you have done one of the special ones!

2.  Player is known on the Discord server and has done a lot for the community.
    
3.  Player did a live play that was above 5 min long (separate maps or 1 map, whatever). A minimum of 2 IGMs (or admins) must have seen the liveplay. (Staff decides when this will happen)

5.  Player is trusted by one of the owner/admins and they approve of the player's verification

#### _All of the above rules may be changed if we think they should be different or if they are unbalanced._
