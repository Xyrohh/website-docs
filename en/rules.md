<h3><i  class="shield icon"></i> Moderation policy</h3>

Unlike other infractions, we have a fixed moderation policy for hacking rules. If you are caught breaking those rules, your account will be wiped. It means all your scores will be deleted. You will also get one strike.

If you get wiped again, you will get a second strike. After 3 strikes, your account will be restricted.

You may appeal 1 month after your restriction, unless you judge you haven't been restricted for a legitimate reason.

If you want to appeal, you may email us at [accounts@kawata.pw](mailto:accounts@kawata.pw).
