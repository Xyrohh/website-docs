<h3><i class="warning icon"></i> Cheating rules</h3>

#### Even though Kawata is a cheating server, we are enforcing a few rules, to make sure playing on Kawata is a fun and rewarding experience for everyone!
#### _Failure to comply with the rules in this section will result in an **account wipe and a strike**._

##### Timewarp
Timewarp has specific set limits: your Timewarp speed must be at minimum 60% of 1.5x speed for Double Time*, and 60% of 1x speed for nomod.

##### Aim Correction/Aim Assist:
Below listed are the HIGHEST allowed settings and/or whether or not the cheat is allowed for each of the most common aim assist tools for osu!. If your cheat is not listed, ask a moderator.

#### _Here are more details:_

**Ainu/hq.af's** "SAVE ME" is **allowed** (no limit);

**MPGH's** default AC is **allowed**;

**Skooter's AC** is **allowed**; 
Its Strength must be at or below 60, but can only be a whole number.

**osu!buddy's AA** is **allowed**; but must be equal to or below the following settings.
*Strength*: 11
*Aim Start Distance*: 666

**Kat's AA** is **allowed**;
Its Strength cannot exceed 1.5x.

**Assist.games** AA is **allowed**
Its Strength cannot exceed 66.

**Maple** AA is **allowed** but must be equal to or below the following settings.

66 **Without DT**, 100 **With DT**.

0.6 **Without DT**, 1.0 **With DT**.

For Maple That's:
60 **Without DT**, 100 **With DT**.


##### Flashlight:
FL Removers are **allowed**, but only in certain circumstances.
If a map's difficulty is higher than 7 Stars After Mods, (Meaning If you apply a mod and the star rating goes above 7 stars), you cannot use flashlight remover.

##### Multiple Cheats:
You can't now have more than **ONE** cheat instance/client open at the same time. this also applies to combining cheats. doing so, you will be banned.

*The only exception for this rule is combining osu!rx (V1 or V2) with Kat's AA/any kind of Aim assist that doesn't have timewarp & relax.*

##### Score modifiers:
Score multipliers, as well as any mods that modify your results (accuracy, miss counts...) are prohibited.

##### CS modifiers:
CS modifiers may only be set to 1 below the original CS of the map (after mods).

#### _Here are more details:_

For NoMod plays: Default CS - 1 (eg. CS4 -> CS3);
For HR plays: Default CS - 0.77 (eg. CS4 -> CS3.23);
For EZ plays: Default CS - 2 (eg. CS4 -> CS2).

##### These values must be applied to the map AFTER MODS ARE APPLIED. To check the CS, turn off your CS changer, reload the map and check in the top left corner where it says "CS: xxx AR: xxx OD: xxx"

#### Other Important Notes:
For Ainu users, make sure the client you use was downloaded on MPGH, the Skoot.er Discord server or the Ainu Xheaters Discord server, otherwise it contains prohibited features.

Things like: Relax hacks, AR Changers, Enlighten (Un-HD), and other stuff that wasn't listed in the hacking rules ARE ALLOWED. You can also ask one of the staff members if you still need clarification.

<h3><i class="warning icon"></i> Specific Gamemodes Rules</h3>

#### CTB:
Hyperwalk maps are not allowed.

<h3><i class="shield icon"></i> Moderation policy</h3>

Unlike other infractions, we have a fixed moderation policy for hacking rules.
If you get caught breaking any of the Hacking Rules, it will result in a wipe of your account's scores if you cannot prove you weren't breaking the rules.

After 3 wipes, your account will be BANNED, not restricted.
This means we'll never ban someone at their first wipe, other than for the Skoot.er AC rule and Multiple cheat client's rules.

You may appeal 1 month after your restriction unless you judge you haven't been restricted for a legitimate reason.

If you want to appeal, you may email us at [accounts@kawata.pw](mailto:accounts@kawata.pw).


#### Score Hunting:

<h3><i class="game icon"></i>Score Hunting</h3>

In September 2022, Kawata introduced Score Hunts!
It's a way to get rewards from playing difficult, strange or techincal maps.
And how it works is pretty simple.

If you want to participate in a score hunt, [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/4CzsqkK). in there you can find the #score-hunting channel, which shows you the active and previous score hunts.

*make sure to read the requirements of __each__ scorehunt. they can change depending on any of them.*

the following will **ALWAYS** be true for scorehunts.
 1. Scorehunt Information will be availible in #score-hunting & the [Public Score Hunt Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iabjrE_O52rNifvUi8s1tBqzThGqa699pmwZdGZTCN8/edit?usp=sharing)
 2. Scorehunts will **NOT** allow CS changer.
 3. Scorehunts will follow the rules set here.
 4. Breaking scorehunt rules will incur a normal moderation punishment (See Moderation Policy) + a blacklist from all future scorehunts.
